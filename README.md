# AngryMobExpressDemo

This is a demo of a single-page message board application that allows users to leave complaints, and negative comments, anonymously. The comments can be liked. I tried for hourssss also create a feature where users could comment on the complaints but I'm going to need some help with that. Users can coplain, like, and of course dislike other complaints for now. Scoping up, I'd like to add features like:

top-rated users and comments
complaint of the day
